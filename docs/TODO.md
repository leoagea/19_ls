**TO DO**

When -l flag is there:
	- Symbolic link
	- ~~Retrieve updated date~~
	- retrieve permissions
	- ~~retrieve size~~

When -t flag is there:
	sorting descending if 2 same date, sorting by name ascending
	-retrieve update date
	
When no argument:
	Sorting by ascending name
		first maj
		then min

When this cmd :  make test ARGS="-R -lr libft"
	duplicate
	and name empty type 0 line

Check How symbolic link works and wich data need to be collected sym or not sym

Sorting algo:
	- ~~first bubble for testing~~
	- second check if quick or merge is better to optimize

Check perm link, hard-soft link

Count the sub directories that i went to: 
	store the parent dir

Ls -l, works just to do formatting that depends on the max size file in subdir
